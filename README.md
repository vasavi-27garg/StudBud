## A3: Web App Prototype (DECO2017)

This website is a prototype of studBud a web application designed to help uni students with their assigments and tasks. 

## Itrations and improvements to the design to make it more user friendly 

## Implimentation of the proposed design and meeting the brief 
Main features offered by the app: 
1. **Todo list**: Create a todo list where users can input there task and deadline details i 
2. **Create an automated priorty list**: User should be able to filter the list by priority and by doing so they should be able to only see high or med or low priority tasks according to the filter they choose. 
3. **Pomodoro timer**: Create a timer which has pre-set timers for work and break 
4. **music player**: A beautiful music player which plays from the selection of muisc files avalible
5. **A smooth and easy to follow UI**: Users should be able to follow and find all the buttons with ease and know what actions to take on the page 

## Sruggles >_<
1. While working on the creating connecting the calander and the list it was espesicaly 
2. Filtering tasks and their priority was one of the things that was the hardest for me to do. 
As the task variable had 4 objects so it was a challange to find the node of priority and target it, to make the filter funtion work, But I was able to find them after a lot of hit and try. 
3. While making the timer, I struggeled to understand the logic behind it and watched mulitple youtube videos to understand who people have done and understand different ways to do it. Moreover I had to firstly google how and what a pomodoro timer is, after that I got a clear understanding of what needs to be done which made it easier to acctually write a sudo code which then lead me to wrtie the actual code. When I was making 2 timers as one for break and one for work, I had to change the classes and ids of the break timer. 
4. Then for the music player, I wanted to create a picture of the album rotate and look like a CD cover, I again watched a lot of tutorials on how to use js to make this effect possible. After watching these tutorials I understood that css also needed to be used and that i had to create classes and style them and then remove and add those classes through js. this was a struggle for me, by watching the tutorials I overcame it.
