## Making Sure the deisgn is relivent to the design Brief 

## Sruggles >_<
1. While working on the creating connecting the calander and the list it was espesicaly 
2.Filtering tasks and their priority was one of the things that was the hardest for me to do. 
As the task variable had 4 objects so it was a challange to find the node of priority and target it, to make the filter funtion work, But I was able to find them after a lot of hit and try. 
3. While making the timer, I struggeled to understand the logic behind it and watched mulitple youtube videos to understand who people have done and understand different ways to do it. Moreover I had to firstly google how and what a pomodoro timer is, after that I got a clear understanding of what needs to be done which made it easier to acctually write a sudo code which then lead me to wrtie the actual code. When I was making 2 timers as one for break and one for work, I had to change the classes and ids of the break timer.
